i still keep checking on you.
not because im hoping for a reply,
but because some part of me wants to know,
if you're okay.
even from a distance.

i scroll to your updates,
your photos, your name,
hoping maybe,
i'll find a piece of you,
that stills remember me.

i will not reach out.
i will not say anything.
but i'm there.
in the silence, in the care,
that never asked for attention.

so if you ever wonder,
yes, i still think of you.
even if you never know.
i'll be here.
